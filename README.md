# Music-Streaming-App

## Overview of the application :- 
TI developed a music streaming web-application using flask application
framework for a dynamic experience to the users. This application has all the basic
functionalities required to make this a scalable project. I have provided classifications
among users like Creator , Non-Creator , Admin , and provided features like , MP3 song
upload , Playlist that could work as album , ratings , statistical data and many more.
Basic CRUD features for songs and playlists are embedded in the application. Data
Validation and Schema relations are taken care of in the application.
